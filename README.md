StepTestPCB
===========

PCB step test for UV exposure on photo sensitive PCBs via transparent film. 

These CAD files are in Eagle format (6.5) and contain a schematic and PCB. 
The Schematic should be empty. 
The layout file contains PCB test patterns to allow you to perform a PCB step test to setup the exposure time of your photo sensitive PCB.
The PCB is printed onto suitable transparent film, laid over the photo sensitive PCB, exposed to UV light for a certain amount of time on each section before developing and etching. 
Two test patterns are present, A1 and B1.
A1: Track to track with specific gaps 
B1: Track and gap to copper flood.

If using an inkjet printer, you will most likely find that the tracks are slightly wider when printed. 
You will also obtain better tracks by printing two printouts and placing one on top of the other to increase the density and reduce the amount of UV light which reaches the PCB.
